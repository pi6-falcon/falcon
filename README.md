## ‚ú® About

This project is the back-end developed for the sixth semester of the Information Systems course at SENAC - 2021.

This application is hosted in the cloud using **AWS** and is pipelined through **Github Actions** with **fully
integrated CI/CD**. The idea was to follow the best **code quality standards** using **Kotlin** & **Spring Boot**,
following standards such as **SOLID**, **Clean Architecture**, **Clean Code** and maintaining a **scalable and fast
architecture**. It is worth mentioning that this application is **not productive or for profit**, it has its sole
purpose as delivery to obtain a grade.

## üöÄ Usage

Make sure you have Java SDK 11 installed. Then, you need to set some environment variables to run:

```shell
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<aws-access-key>
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<aws-secret-key>
export AWS_DYNAMO_ENDPOINT=<aws-dynamo-endpoint>
export SECRET=<jwt-secret>
export JWT_EXPIRATION=<jwt-expiration>
```

And then you can run the program by running:

```shell
./gradlew clean build && ./gradlew bootRun
```

To run tests you can run the following command:

```shell
./gradlew test
```

And you are good to go.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Pipeline and Gitflow

To always continue developing features without any problem, we use Gitflow at this project. In all commit there is a
trigger to run the tests along with SonarQube validations. Every commit done on the `master` branch triggers the build
and deploy to AWS.
